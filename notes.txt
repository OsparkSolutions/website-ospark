- create folder that holds shared snippets of code
- run in cmd 'npm init', call the package name 'toolkit', initial version '0.0.1',
- link to this package from the new ospark website folder
- from ospark website, run an npm install and give it file location of this new folder ('npm install ../toolkit')
- then create subdirectory folder called 'react' inside of the toolkit directory
- in this react folder create a 'ts' file called 'layoutHooks'




- Create a react hook that is going to change when the window size changes
- use 'debouncing' - creating a set of rules to prevent to many renders of the react page while resizing browser

	1. Add event listener to the window for the resize event (only add it once in the components lifecycle)
	2. When the event listener triggers, set a timeout of a 300ms to trigger a 'state update'
	3. We want this hook to output an object that will have its current height and width of the window, and a size breakpoint
		-This object should return : height, width, breakpoint(aka device size)

	*useState, useEffect, useRef will need to be used
